For example, we use specialized equipment like hypochlorous acid generators that are safe and non-toxic for disinfecting hard surfaces and powerful steam machines for cleaning carpets and upholstery."

          paragraph="As professional cleaners, we consider the lives of people in the surrounding environment when we clean, which is why we adapt our cleaning methods for extra caution if there are people in the environment, with compromised health, children, or pets.  Our first priority is the safety of people and we hold our safety protocols to a high standard.  For example, in those special cases, we use a steam mop to clean the floors, refraining from using any chemical solutions while still effectively removing spots.  In cases where chemical solutions are required, we clean the area two times: once with the solution and another time with water to ensure there is no residue left on the surface.  Our cleaning methods can be adapted to ensure we are providing a cleaning service within the clientâ€™s comfort level, because nothing is more important to us than the health and satisfaction of our customers.
